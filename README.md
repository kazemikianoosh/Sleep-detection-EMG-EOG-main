Sleep can be divided into distinct categories, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In REM sleep, the eyes move rapidly from side to side, breathing becomes faster and irregular, and heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. REM sleep is essential for healthy emotion regulation. NREM sleep consists of light sleep and deep sleep. Both light and deep sleep are essential for various processes in the body. The sleep stages can be  easured using the polysomnography method, containing electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), and electroencephalography. Facial EMG shows differences between the sleep stages. EOG is a technique to collect the electrical activity of the eyeâ€™s muscles. It can also be used to track eye movements.
